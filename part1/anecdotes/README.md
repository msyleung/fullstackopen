This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was created for Part1 of the [FullStack Open Course by University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

## Objective

To serve as an introduction to component state and event handlers in React, we were instructed to create an "anecdote" randomizer composed of little quotes of programmer wisdom. Users can vote on their favorite quote and the quote with the most about of votes get a spotlight at the bottom. In this project, I personally learned that design is hard.
