This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was created for Part1 of the [FullStack Open Course by University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

## Objective

To serve as an introduction to component state and event handlers in React, we were given tutorial exercises to run as well as 3 programming exercises to complete.

- courseinfo - an information generator regarding the course information of presumably the FullStack course (a bit meta)
- unicafe - a feedback statistical analysis application that allows users to input feedback and observe the metrics (average and percentage of positive feedback received)
- anecdotes - an anecdote randomizer that allows users to vote for their favorite programming wisdom

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode, though Part 1 is me going through the tutorial & early exercises, it isn't that interesting. The React applications listed above are a bit more engaging to look at.<br />
