This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was created for Part1 of the [FullStack Open Course by University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

## Objective

To serve as an introduction to component state and event handlers in React, we were instructed to create a feedback statistics summary where users can select what feedback they acquired (either by giving or receiving?) and this application generates the total feedback received, average score, and the percentage of positive feedback according to the user input.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Sorry, no tests yet :cry:
